# Measuring The Impact of Cryptographic Algorithms in Throughput

## üß≠ Overview
Throughput is a critical performance metric, but its meaning varies depending on the context:

**General Network Throughput:** Measures how much data is transferred over a secure connection per unit time.

**KEM Throughput:** Measures how many key encapsulation and decapsulation operations can be performed per second.

**Signature Algorithm Throughput:** Measures how many signing and verification operations can be performed per second.

Each of these has different implications for performance, scalability, and security in cryptographic systems.

## üîê General Network Throughput (with Cryptographic Overhead)
This measures the actual data transfer rate over a secure channel (e.g., TLS with post-quantum crypto), factoring in the overhead introduced by cryptographic operations.

### Metrics
- **Throughput (Mbps or Gbps):** Total data transferred per second.
- **Overhead (%):** Difference in throughput between encrypted and unencrypted channels. We can also compare between multiple algorithms.

### Example Scripts
```bash
# Example using iperf3 to measure network throughput
iperf3 -c <server_ip> -t 60

# Example using Wireshark to capture packets
wireshark -i eth0 -k

# Example using OpenSSL to establish a secure connection
openssl s_client -connect <server_ip>:443 -tls1_3
```

## üîë KEM Algorithm Throughput
This focuses on the rate of key encapsulation and decapsulation operations, which are critical during the handshake phase of secure communication.

### Metrics
- **Encapsulation throughput (ops/sec)**
- **Decapsulation throughput (ops/sec)**
- **Key size, ciphertext size, shared secret size**

### Example Scripts
```bash
# Example using PQC benchmarking tools
pqc_bench -kem <kem_algorithm>


# Example using OpenSSL with PQC extensions
openssl speed -seconds 5 mlkem1024
```
## ‚úçÔ∏è Signature Algorithm Throughput
This measures the performance of digital signature schemes, used for authentication and integrity.

### Metrics
- **Signing throughput (ops/sec)**
- **Verification throughput (ops/sec)**
- **Signature size, public/private key size**

### Example Scripts
```bash
# Example using PQC benchmarking tools
pqc_bench -sig <signature_algorithm>


# Example using OpenSSL with PQC extensions
openssl speed -seconds 5 --signature-algorithms 
```
