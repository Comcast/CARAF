# Use Case Categories
Cryptographic systems can be deployed in various scenarios, each with unique requirements and constraints. This page categorizes these use cases to help identify relevant performance metrics. Categories are important because they help in understanding the specific needs and challenges of different deployment environments. A real deployment can fall into multiple categories. For example, an IoT device can fall under Low Computational Power, Software-Based Cryptographic Implementations, and High Energy Constraints use cases.
To provide a quick overview, the table below summarizes key categories, their subcategories, example use cases, and links to detailed sections:
