# PQBench Changes

This file gives an overview of the changes in each version of PQBench.

## PQBench Releases
- [PQBench 1.1 (CARAF 3.1)](#pqbench-11-caraf-31)
- [PQBench 1.0 (CARAF 3.0)](#pqbench-10-caraf-30)

## PQBench 1.1 (CARAF 3.1)
This release focuses on adding new metrics:
- Computational performance metrics: shared key derivation time.
- Memory performance metrics: key size, signature size, and memory consumption.
- Compound metrics: certificate throughput, TLS throughput.

Additionally, we also added more details to the types (i.e., signature and KEM) and list of PQC algorithms.

## PQBench 1.0 (CARAF 3.0)

This release focuses on PQBench, a performance evaluation tool and guide that offer a curated collection of cryptographic use cases, each mapped to relevant evaluation metrics tailored for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

It provides:
- A categorized list of cryptographic use cases.
- Mappings between use cases and appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Practical guidance on selecting metrics based on deployment context.
- Step-by-step instructions for measuring system performance post-migration.
