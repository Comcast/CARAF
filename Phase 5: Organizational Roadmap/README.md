# Phase 5: Organizational Roadmap
The success of any roadmap will, however, depend on having some foundational constructs in place. The enterprise must have coherent crypto policy that supports and guides different teams in making decisions about their cryptography choices. This policy must be enforced with an appropriate *responsible*, *accountable*, *consulted*, and *informed* matrix. The enterprise crypto policy must tie in to associated organizational processes. Based on the risk mitigation strategy selected from the previous phase ([Phase 4](https://github.com/comcast/CARAF/tree/main/Phase%204%3A%20Secure%20Assets)), this phase will provide list of modifications/additions needed in the organization process or roadmap for consistent communication. 

PQC guideline should be incorporated into:
- **Security Architecture Reviews**: These reviews should assess the crypto agility of the proposed architecture.
- **Product Development**: Development teams should be trained to select solutions with better crypto agility. For example, when choosing an open-source component, they should prioritize components with greater flexibility, better support, and historically faster patching time.
- **Incident Response Plan**: This plan should include plans to address vulnerabilities in internally approved crypto-solutions.
- **Third-Party Risk Assessment**: This assessment should consider the organization's responsiveness to vulnerability disclosure.
- **Change Management Plan**: This plan should include defined process for updates to cryptography and supporting systems, e.g., key management systems, hardware security modules, etc.

A comprehensive list of actions would depend on the country, industry, and mitigation strategy. Please feel free to consult the standards, guidelines, and tools included in the [Resources](https://github.com/Comcast/CARAF/tree/main/Phase%205%3A%20Organizational%20Roadmap/Resources) folder for each phase to build your roadmap.
